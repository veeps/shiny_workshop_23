# Interactive Visuals with Shiny Workshop

## Overview
This workshop is designed as a one-day intro to Shiny workshop. Today we'll cover some fundamentals to building Shiny apps and design-thinking. After this workshop, you will be able to:

- Build a Shiny App
- Load your own data
- Understand reactive functions
- Deploy to shinyapps.io

## Workshop format
We will be walking through examples throughout the course. If you get lost following along the live coding sessions, you can see the "03_final.R" file for the full code.

We are going to work our way towards building [this](https://veeps.shinyapps.io/shiny_workshop_23).

At the end of each break, I will push the updates for what we've done so far so you can follow along.
